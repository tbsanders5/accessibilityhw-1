# Horiseon Marketing - Accessibility Page

## Description

The reason behind the build for the Horiseon page is to clean up an exisiting code, make it more accessible to those with certain dissablities, and to make the code more streamlined and efficient. Using semantic tags to make things in the cose easier to find and identify, adding alt tags to all of the images to make it easier on those using screen readers, and creating a CSS that is more condensened and accessible.

Making all of these points on the page gives us a cleaner, better, and more accessible code.

## Installation

No installations need to be made for this page.

## Usage

Normal webpage layout, links across the top take you to different areas on the page. It is not set up for mobile and therefore is best used on a full screen browser.
